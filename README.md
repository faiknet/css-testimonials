## Overview
During this challenge, I practiced creating a testimonials section using CSS Grid while keeping responsive design principles in mind. I experimented with different layouts and design options to find the best approach that would work on a wide range of screen sizes and orientations. This challenge helped me improve my skills in creating flexible and visually engaging layouts and accessible layouts using grid.
